# Day 1

### 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 

Blockchain is a distributed database which stores its data in blocks where each block is linked to its previous block, hence the name. There is no central computer running this database, instead it runs on a network and anyone can join the network. The data stored on blockchain is public and anyone can see it. But the data is immutable and cannot be modified once stored.

### 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is.

Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain and allow us to interact with the blockchain.

### 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

- A script is a piece of code to read data from a blockchain.
- A transaction is a piece of code to write data to a blockchain. This costs money in terms of gas.

# Day 2

### 1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

1. Safety and Security
2. Clarity
3. Approachability
4. Developer Experience
5. Resource Oriented Programming

### 2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

1. **Safety and Security:** Extremely important as it involves $ whether crypto, NFT or any other data.
2. **Clarity:** Contracts should be as clear and easy to understand as possible for users to make informed decisions and be safe. 
3. **Approachability:** Easy for new developers to get started.
4. **Developer Experience:** Help developers to be more productive and focused.
